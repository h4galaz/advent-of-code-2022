# Advent of Code 2022
> **Advent of Code** is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in **any** programming language you like. People use them as **interview prep**, **company training**, **university coursework**, **practice problems**, **a speed contest**, or to **challenge each other**.

## Personal solutions
Those are my personal solutions and approaches for the different tasks.
I also added a little utility to display the current state of the private leaderboard i have with my colleagues.

My language of choice for this year is my beloved **Python**.
